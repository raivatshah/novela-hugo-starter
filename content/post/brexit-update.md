In two months time, On March 29th, 2019, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union, whether they have a deal with them or not. While a unanimous vote from the EU nations is required to provide an extension to the existing deadline if required, it is unlikely that it will happen.

So far, Britain does not have a deal, as the Withdrawal Agreement that was negotiated between the EU and Britain did not pass Britain's House of Commons, suffering a 434-202 defeat on January 15th. The House expects British Prime Minister Theresa May to come up with a 'Plan B' by January 29th. However, the European Union Refuses to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, and many speculate that May will again present the same deal, with possible changes to the Irish Backstop and other points of concerns that were raised.

The Withdrawal Agreement talks about a transition period until 2020, where the EU and Britain will discuss details to maintain a close relationship. During this period, the country would be subjected to EU laws, will be contributing to its budget and remain in the EU Customs Union. Britain, however, won't be allowed in any of the decision-making processes. The fact that Britain would remain in the customs union also temporarily solves their land border issue in Northern Ireland, as many do not want to have a hard border with Ireland, which had previously led to a conflict in the region called "the troubles". This agreement was finalized on November 14th,2018.

However, the Deal has led to resignations in May's government after the snap elections, including from the Secretary of State for exiting the European Union, Dominic Raab. The deal has also affected hardline Brexit-ers who wanted to have control over its border, be able to make its own trade deals with other countries and have their own laws, aspects which directly led to January 15th results.

### January 29th Vote and Results

On January 29th, The House directed Theresa May to look for an alternative deal for Brexit with Brussels, which she is expected to propose to the parliament on February 13th. However, EU's Chief negotiator stated that there would not renegotiate the deal since it is unclear as to what Britain actually wants in the deal. The reason for looking for an alternative is due to the Irish Backstop, which would keep the UK indefinitely in the EU Customs Union.

The United Kingdom is facing a real possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which many pro-Europeans believe would adversely affect the economy, something the pro-Brexit supporters expect in the short run. The shocks from this will ripple through the international markets and will affect Britains credibility as a major financial centre. In my opinion, it could be better if the British Parliament creates a Brexit deal, including how they will be dealing with their land border with Ireland, before commencing in re-negotiations. To do so, they will first need to ask the EU to extend the deadline.
