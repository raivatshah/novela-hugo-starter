+++
Appeasement is a form of foreign policy used to pacify an aggressive country through negotiations and concessions in order to prevent a broader conflict. The most notable example of appeasement is in the 1930s when Britain had adopted the same policy for Nazi-Germany and Fascist Italy, in order to avoid another war. As Europe was still reeling from the first world war, this policy was acceptable to the public up until the Munich Agreement.

The Munich Agreement is seen as a failed act of appeasement. In the agreement, the major powers of Europe at the time, which included Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany (the Soviet Union was not present in the meet) agreed to Hitler's terms of partial-invasion of Czechoslovakia, and in return to cease its expansionist policies. The reason for the invasion was due to the ethnic speaking Germans living in the Sudetenland, bordering Germany. Despite agreeing to a partial invasion, Germany went on to invade the whole of Czechoslovakia.

While many people believed that appeasement led the Germans to have just appropriations after the Treaty of Versailles, Appeasement failed to stop the German expansion. This ultimately led to World War II. While the act of appeasement is seen in today's time, using it as a long-term foreign policy can have larger consequences.
