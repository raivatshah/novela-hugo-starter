Hello Reader! 

It has been three wonderful years of this journey in writing and managing my blog: World News Simplified. It started with a Blogspot site and now here we are! 

The reason I had started writing a blog was that I had no friends who were interested in discussing the issues that plague us today, and many of them ask me why what is happening in a certain country. It was just this simple idea that made me work on the blog.

But the journey has been much more than content writing. Even though I outsourced my logo designing and website making, I equally learnt more about managing them and other marketing strategies, things that helped me reach out to everyone. It has been an enriching experience. 

However, I have been inconsistent in updating the blog and posting new articles. Its not because I don't want to anymore, but each article is written with extensive research involved, and one has to weigh both sides and ensure that the article is not biassed towards one ideology. Among other things, it is difficult for one person to follow the news, and keep writing and researching new articles every week or at times every day. 

As such for the time being, I won't be working on the blog anymore. That does not mean I won't stop writing. I might occasionally post articles here, but ill be heading a medium blog account where I'll be posting opinion articles regarding what is happening around the world.
