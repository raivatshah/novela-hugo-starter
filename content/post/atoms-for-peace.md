After seeing the power of the Atomic Bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, it was clear that the United States had control of a technology that made them a superpower. To ensure the monopoly on nuclear technology, the United States passed the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, with the purpose of keeping the technology and the knowledge behind it a secret, even from the allies who had helped in the development of it. However, despite the measures, the Soviets were able to test their own atomic bomb five years later.

Hence, On December 8th, 1953, Then US President Dwight. D. Eisenhower delivered a speech titled 'Atoms for Peace' and initiated a program of the same. Eisenhower believed that rather than keeping the technology a secret, they can provide the knowledge and materials required by getting an assurance that the countries use it for peaceful purposes. This he believed would not only stop other countries pursuit of nuclear weapons but would also ensure that there aren't any used in a first strike or during conventional warfare.

The program resulted in the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who ensures that countries use nuclear technology in a peaceful manner. Under the program, countries like Israel, Iran, India and Pakistan received the technology and knowledge of the same.

The program resulted in advances in fields such as medicine and agriculture, But it also resulted in India to denote its own atomic bomb, who was subsequently followed by Pakistan. Even in today's time, Nations such as Iran and North Korea are being accused of having a secret nuclear weapons program. It is all a culmination of the speech in 1953 and the events that followed.

The program was also a political move to have influence over nations and to do it before the Soviet Union came up with its own program. The Atoms for peace program made us realise the dangers of nuclear energy, diverted us from making it as another conventional bomb and also set up an international organisation to monitor nuclear proliferation. While the program can be seen as a failure, it can also be said that a lot of good came out of it as well.
