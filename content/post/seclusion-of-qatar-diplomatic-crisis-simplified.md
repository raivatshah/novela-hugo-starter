title = "Seclusion of Qatar; Diplomatic Crisis Simplified"

+++
Recently Qatar has been accused of sponsoring terrorism and interfering in internal affairs of its neighbours like Saudi Arabia. It reached a point that on June 5th, 2017 Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain along with UAE and Maldives ceased diplomatic ties with Qatar. This was followed by other Gulf states and then as of June 10th 2017, 9 countries seized ties with Qatar while 12 others have reduced their diplomatic relations with the Gulf state. The question is, how did this become so bad so fast? and what will be the repercussions of it?

### Reasons for Seclusion

As mentioned earlier, 9 countries and 2 governments have seized ties with Qatar. These include Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Bahrain, Maldives, Comoros, Senegal, Yemen, & Mauritania.

The government of Somaliland and Toruk-based government in Libya (both not recognised internationally) have also cut ties with Qatar.

Before we continue, this is Qatar

And these are its neighbours

From the map, it can be seen that Qatar's neighbours have cut diplomatic ties, as well as put sanctions on the country. Qatar is completely cut off by land and many of the ships that come to Qatar need to make a stop at UAE. Countries such as Saudi Arabia has asked Qatar citizens to leave the country within 2 weeks while Bahrain has asked Qatar's officials to leave the country within 48 hours. But why are these countries being hostile with this nation?

There are a number of reasons, and this is not the first time this act has been pulled off. You have to understand that Middle Eastern politics is also based on their religion and how they perceive things and attempt to bring order in the region. Saudi Arabia and Iran are the supposed power in the middle east, with both having a different majority (Saudi Arabia is a right-wing conservative Sunni Islamic kingdom while Iran is the Twelver Shia Islamic Republic).

Both of these countries have taken different stances. With Saudi Arabia leaning towards the UK and the US while Iran-leaning towards Russia and China. In the [Syrian civil war](https://www.worldnewssimplified.xyz/post/the-syrian-conflict-simplified/ "The Syrian Conflict Simplified"), Iran has taken the side of Bashar-Al Assad while Saudi Arabia supports the rebel group. As of January 2016, Saudi Arabia and Iran do not have diplomatic ties however Switzerland has opted to represent Saudi interests in Iran and vice-versa. So how does Qatar fit into all this?

Apparently Qatar has been accused of having links with terror organisations such as the Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, ISIL, Muslim Brotherhood etc ( it is been reported that Qatar has paid around a billion-dollar to terror organisations in order to strike a deal to free Qatari royals which were held hostage and create a safe passage for people fleeing the conflict in Syria). It has also been accused of having closer ties with Iran, interfering in internal affairs of other countries and funding its state news outlet Al-Jazeera, who has critically accused countries like Saudi Arabia, and Egypt on certain issues.

The final push for these sanctions was given by the US President Donald Trump where he praised Saudi Arabia for their efforts to fight terrorism in a speech delivered in front of 50 Muslim-majority countries. The stage was set.

### Effects on other things

While some of the countries followed Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and UAE, others downgraded their diplomatic stance with Qatar and the majority of the countries called for a resolution of this crisis. The initial response from the United States for this issue was...

However, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Minister James Mattis started to diffuse the crisis. Kuwait and Oman have remained neutral on this issue, and Kuwait has volunteered to be the mediator in solving this issue.

  
Furthermore, Air travel has severely been affected by this crisis as Qatar Airways have to divert flights to Europe and Asia through other countries airspaces such as Iran, Jordan and Turkey. Many Nationals are stuck in Qatar due to this issue.

98% of food is imported while 1% of food is grown by themselves (Qatar). Shortly after the diplomatic ties were cut off, it was reported that many people had begun to stockpile food. However, Qatar's government has said that they are prepared to withstand these sanctions. Iran and Turkey have pledged diplomatic support to Qatar and to aid the country with the food supply.

Lastly, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain banned news outlet Al-Jazeera. UAE and Bahrain announced that any form of sympathy towards Qatar on social media will be met with imprisonment, fine or both.

### The Ultimatum 

![](/images/qatar-5.jpeg)

On 23rd June UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain presented a list of demands to the Kuwaiti mediators which Qatar has to accept in order to end the crisis. Qatar was given 10 days to accept their demands. These demands include

* The closing of Al-Jazeera and other news outlets funded directly and indirectly by the government.
* Reducing diplomatic ties with Iran to just trade and commerce
* Closing of Turkey's military base in Qatar
* Cutting ties with all terror organisations and removing any designated terrorists residing in Qatar.
* End interference in internal affairs of other countries (such as supporting the opposition etc.)
* Paying reparations for all the wrongs done in the past.

Qatar was given 10 days to accept these demands. US officials stated that these demands are very hard to meet for Qatar but work can be done on them. Turkey said it will not be closing its military base in Qatar. After the deadline was extended, foreign ministers of UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Egypt met in Cairo to discuss Qatar declining their list of demands. The 4 countries said that this is the evidence that shows Qatar has been funding terror organisations. Sources state that these sanctions would continue until Qatar changes its policy.

### What's next?

With Qatar not accepting the demands, it is unsure how the crisis would resolve. This crisis has affected the stability of the region as well as secluded a nation. Do note that countries such as USA and India has interests in the region and are one of the many countries who want to resolve the crisis (USA has a base there used to fight ISIS, while Indian nationals are there on a working permit). Not only these countries, but many nationals are potentially stuck in the country. And as crisis prolongs things can get worse. We can only hope that international cooperation can resolve this crisis.
