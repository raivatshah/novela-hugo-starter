title = "Seclusion of Qatar; Diplomatic Crisis Simplified"

+++
Recently Qatar has been accused of sponsoring terrorism and interfering in internal affairs of its neighbours like Saudi Arabia. It reached a point that on June 5th, 2017 Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain along with UAE and Maldives ceased diplomatic ties with Qatar. This was followed by other Gulf states and then as of June 10th 2017, 9 countries seized ties with Qatar while 12 others have reduced their diplomatic relations with the Gulf state. The question is, how did this become so bad so fast? and what will be the repercussions of it?

### Reasons for Seclusion

As mentioned earlier, 9 countries and 2 governments have seized ties with Qatar. These includes Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Bahrain, Maldives, Comoros, Senegal, Yemen, & Mauritania.

The government of Somaliland and Toruk-based government in Libya (both not recognised internationally) have also cut ties with Qatar.
