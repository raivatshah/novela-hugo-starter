If you Google Syria, then on the first page itself you will see news articles related to the war that's happening there, compared to say, South Africa, which will be showcase tourism and flight options. There are a number of articles showing how many have died in Syria, the number of refugees fleeing the country, the chemical attacks, ISIS attacks and international disagreements to act upon the situation. So what is the common ground to which all these dots connect to? You have to understand that this is a very complicated situation, with lots of background information required to understand the conflict.

The Syrian Civil war has been raging on for 6 years now and around 470,000 people have died with 6.3 million internally displaced and 4.3 million in besieged areas. Unlike other civil wars, (such as the American civil war which was fought between the Confederates and the Union), the belligerents of this civil war consist of the government-led forces of President Bashar Al- Assad, The Free Syrian Army, Jaysh Al-Islam, Ahrar Al-Sham, Tahrir Al-Sham, & Rojava. Other belligerents include ISIS, Iran, Hezbollah, Russia, Turkey, United States and its allies. By the time you have reached this sentence, you would have lost count of the number of belligerents in the war as well as their names. But this should give you an idea as to what is the current situation in Syria. And yes it is a pretty big deal. Let's break this down.

## The Arab Spring

It all started back in 2010 when the "Arab spring" was taking place in the Middle East. Arab Spring is known to be a series of protests against the regimes in the Middle East due to many reasons, one of them being the dictatorial rule they had in the country as well as poor economic conditions faced by that country under their rule. This movement was first started in Tunisia after a local vendor's self-immolation due to the injustice of the local police. This resulted in a nationwide protest which ended the reign of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. After Tunisia, other Middle-Eastern countries also faced similar protests and turmoil's, Egypt saw its President (Hosni Mubarak) being ousted, who was ruling the country since 1980 and a key ally for the West. Monarchs in Jordan and Morocco decided to reduce their powers and hold parliamentary elections, while Bahrain and Yemen sought foreign intervention (Given to them by Saudi Arabia) which made sure that an all-out civil war does not break out. For Libya, A NATO intervention resulted in the death of Libya's ruler Col. Muammar al-Gaddafi after a Civil war had broken out. Overall the Arab Spring did result in a political transition from dictatorship to a democracy, however, this also resulted in Political instability in the region.

So how does all this fit into the Syrian conflict?

## Protest and Violent Response

Similar to other Middle Eastern countries, Syria also saw protests against the ruling regime of Bashar Al-Assad. The Assad family has been ruling Syria since 1971 and didn't want to lose power now. Hence during the protests in March 2011, the government attempted to suppress the protest with an armed response. This resulted in many army defectors (which created the Free Syrian Army) and by mid-2011 Syria had itself in a brutal civil war that has been raging on ever since. However, unlike Libya, where a NATO intervention helped the opposition oust Gaddafi, An international intervention could potentially cause a world war and here's why.

Syria is in an important geopolitical position and has allies such as Iran and Russia, which are supporting the Regime. Meanwhile, the Free Syrian Army is being supported by Saudi Arabia and the US-led coalition forces. Since Russian troops are on the ground helping the Syrian government, any attack on them from the US and such can cause an immense political tension between the 2 countries. A similar incident took place when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane after it violated its airspace (In the defence of Turkey's government, they did not allow Russian fighters in its airspace and had repetitively informed Russia about it) this resulted in a lot of tension between the 2 countries, with Russia even announcing that its citizens should avoid travelling to Turkey.

All in all this chaos also gave way for other armed separatist groups as well as terror organisations like ISIS, which also controls a lot of ground in Syria. As of now, Iran is supplying weapons to the Syrian Government, Russia is using its planes to target Free Syrian Army and other armed groups meanwhile the US-led coalition forces have been targeting ISIS as well as showing its active support to the Free Syrian Army, however, they did not take any actions until this year(see Chemical attacks).

## International Response to

### Refugee Crisis

The brutal civil war has resulted in a lot of refugees fleeing their hometown and into the neighbouring countries. As many as 5 million people have fled the country, the majority of which now reside in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. UNHCR (United Nations of High Commissioner for Refugees) were not prepared to handle such an influx of refugees, this resulted in poor conditions at the refugee camp along with shortages of basic necessities.

Some of the refugees have attempted to go to Europe through Turkey or from the Mediterranean Sea. These refugee boats sometimes capsize resulting in the death of these refugees. This crisis came into limelight when a young Syrian boy was washed up faced down on an island in Greece. The European Union has been reluctant to accept refugees due to reasons such as possible terrorists that might be coming with them to the fact that the refugees might destabilise the economy (or take away jobs).

### ISIS incursion and the chemical attacks

ISIS has taken advantage of a divided Syria and captured some of its areas. The limelight of this issue came when ISIS took over the ancient city of Palmyra and destroyed several historical monuments and sites. After all this (and taking over parts of Iraq) United States coming in the civil war and carrying out airstrikes against ISIS. It is to be noted that both the sides have at times bombed hospitals in rebel-held or government-held areas at times, which just contributes to more violence

#### Chemical Attacks

The Syrian government has been accused of carrying out 2 chemical attacks against the rebels, the first one in August 2013 when rockets with sarin gas were fired in suburbs of Damascus. That following year President Assad stated that it'll destroy Syria's chemical stockpile. However, in April 2017 another major chemical attack took place in a rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. The western powers blame the Syrian Government for the attack. Syrian government states that the story is fabricated while Russia states that an airstrike hit a rebel depot carrying chemical weapons. This prompted US president Donald Trump to carry out a missile attack on an airstrip which was supposedly used to carry out the deadly chemical attack. This was the first-ever intervention by the United States in this conflict and that too against the Syrian Government.

### Peace Talks

As the Civil war progressed, the search for peace in the region becomes very important. Talks were held in 2012 and 2016 but neither side is agreeing to the others demands. However several ceasefires have been successfully been implemented, though for a short time only.

## So what's next?

We don't know. This war can rage on for a long time unless the international community comes together and resolves this conflict. This not only includes the civil war but the terrorism by ISIS and the refugee crisis. Because what our leaders do to resolve this conflict will always be remembered for generations.

And that's the Syrian Conflict. There are still some of the things we didn't touch upon like the internal disagreements (Turkey and the US due to US support of Kurdish Force) to how this civil war has affected the relations between other countries.

So this was Syrian Conflict simplified, lookout for my next post.
