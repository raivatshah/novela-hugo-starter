+++
Some say that you're not allowed to take pictures when you visit this country, others state that it's forbidden to talk to the locals unless in the presence of your tour guide. And most notably you cannot roam around the city of Pyongyang alone. These are some of the most popular beliefs about North Korea, the most reclusive nation on the planet.

By reclusive I mean a tightly controlled and an isolated command economy (a command economy means that the government decides what to produce, meaning that all the industries are owned by the government, i.e. no private companies), limited access to the situation going on in that country for the world (and similarly limited access for them to the outside world). In short, a country that does not want to be involved in world affairs. And yet it is.

We have seen or read articles related to North Korea, sanctions on this country, a war of words with the US, South Korea, Japan etc. But how did this happen? Why is the United States so concerned about this isolated county? Let's break it down.

### **Origins of this issue**

#### **Independence from Japan & the Korean War**

The Korean peninsula had been under the control of the Japanese Empire up until the end of World War 2. This also brought the division between the North and South. How? Thanks to the Soviet Union and the United States. The Soviet Union started taking over the Korean peninsula from the North while the United States from the South. They decided to divide the Korean peninsula along the 38th Parallel (Latitude). The objective of this was to later unify the Korean peninsula, however, the negotiations failed and thus North Korea (also known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or DPRK) was established on September 9th, 1948 and was ruled by Kim Sung II. While after an UN-supervised election, South Korea (also known as the Republic of Korea) was formed on August 15, 1948.

Kim Sung II adopted communism and Stalinist approach after taking inspiration from its ally the Soviet Union. Stalinist are a set of policies undertaken by Stalin that includes a command economy, use of propaganda to establish a personality cult around the dictator and having secret police to maintain social order (and submission).

Up to the years leading to the Korean War, Kim Sung II attempted to cause a communist uprise in South Korea in order to reunify the Korean Peninsula. With all in vain, Kim Sung II ordered the attack on South all along the 38th parallel. At that time South Korea had inexperienced and weak-armed forces compared to North Korea (who had troops and support of the Soviet Union and China) and there were very less US armed forces present in the country. This resulted in a shift capture of Seoul and pushing back the South Korean and US forces up till the Pusan perimeter. After an appeal in the United Nations (which only recognised South Korea as the proper government in the peninsula at the time) approved a US-led Intervention.

The Korean Peninsula could have been unified by the US-led forces if China hadn't sent aid to North Korea. The war had reached a Stalemate. After signing the Korean Armistice(both South Korea or the US leadership did not sign the armistice, but the commander in chief of the UN forces did along with China), the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) was established, extending 2 kilometres in both directions along the re-established 38th parallel border. It is to be noted that no formal treaty had been signed that ended the war and the hostilities between the 2 countries have been at a minimum.

#### **Post-Korean War and Nuclear Program**

Post the Korean War, North Korea's economy grew drastically, even Che Guevara, then Cuba's government minister stated after visiting North Korea that Cuba should model its economy after it. At the time North Korea was focusing on its mining industry and military development.

However in the 1970s, due to the rise in prices of foreign oil along with the fall in prices of their minerals, North Korea's economy was hit badly. This also affected North Korea's ability to keep up with its surrounding nations as their economy become more computer-based along with the advancements in technology. At the time, Kim Sung II heavily relied on foreign debts to keep the economy alive.

As time went by, the relations between North Korea and South Korea (including the rest of the world) was in turmoil. Numerous negotiations regarding reuniting families to economic cooperation started, stalled, ended and restarted and so on. In this period (1970-80s) North Korea announced its growing nuclear program and experiments regarding uranium enrichment (the first step in creating nuclear weapons). This was the first time international tension regarding this country began.

Conditions in North Korea became worse after the death of Kim Sung II in 1994, who was succeeded by Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong IL decided that the country should follow an "Army First" policy, turning a communistic government into a military dictatorship. During the 90s North Korea suffered famine after first suffering floods followed by droughts. This coupled with an already failing economy made North Korea heavily rely on International Aid.

After the Death of Kim Jong IL, his son and current leader of North Korea Kim Jong-Un rules the country. Unlike his predecessors, Kim Jong-UN is pushing the country's nuclear program. And this is where the problem starts.

It is to be noted that North Korea is also been accused of human rights violations, having labour camps and having most of the populations in worsening conditions and poverty.

#### **Recent events and tension in the region**

North Korea has been carrying out a nuclear weapons test despite international sanctions. Current United States President Donald Trump has stated that "all options are on the table" regarding this issue though he said he wants to solve this issue diplomatically. Japan, on the other hand, is seeing a surge in demand for nuclear bunkers after President Trump deployed USS Carl Vinson and a strike group to the Korean peninsula. Japan has also conducted drills in schools in case of an attack from North Korea. As of the recent missile test North Korea conducted, they have the ability to attack a US naval base in Guam. And it's stated that their tests will continue till their missiles can reach the US mainland. Sounds scary? It is. Because such capabilities will make North Korea have leverage on the United States. One of the reasons why North Korea is pursuing this is because of the US-South Korea military exercises, which makes it an act of aggression towards the country according to them.

### **Lifestyle, propaganda and tourism in North Korea (Debunking your beliefs)**

#### **Tourism and lifestyle.**

At the beginning of this post, I addressed several beliefs about North Korea and how it is to travel in the country. So is it all true? Surprisingly no. According to several travel blogs I referred too, there isn't any restriction in talking with the locals or the fact that you can roam around alone in the city (though not for a long time). Few things to note are that you cannot travel alone to North Korea. You will also be in a group when travelling to this country. And the schedule is very tight. All in all, it is not that bad or scary to visit North Korea.

In terms of Lifestyle, the travel blogs state that the people there are influenced by the propaganda and ideology of the regime. As per the extreme poverty faced in the country, it might not be true to some extent. People there do have access to the outside world but that too is limited. That not only includes access to the internet but also some of the basic ingredients.

> "During one long drive into the countryside of Pyongyang, one of our minders shyly asked me if I had a cookbook with me. She was interested in making new dishes – especially pasta for her son – but had nowhere to get recipes. I tried to share a simple dish from memory, but soon realized she had no access to one ingredient we take for granted: paprika."

#### **Propaganda**

Propaganda's in North Korea include altering the historical facts of the Korean war, making it seem that the Supreme leader vanquished the imperialist and the oppressors from ruling their country, to changing the place of birth from a normal city to a very holy place in the country in order to show that their Supreme leader is close to God (Some people even bow before the status of their former leaders before going to work). Such Propaganda is being fed to the North Koreans. Along with limited access to the outside world, shortages in certain amenities and food, some of them even believe that this is a normal life.

### **What's next?**

This is also a very uncertain situation. North Korea does have a valid point for possessing Nuclear weapons (as a deterrent to any US invasion) however not complying with International rules and regulations also keeps them at fault. Along with labour and concentration camps which violate human rights. Even negotiations with the country aren't productive. As for the current issue, the tension on the Korean Peninsula, we can only hope that it is solved diplomatically. I'm not in any way condoning the actions of this country but international cooperation could defuse the tension in the region and possibly even help North Korea with its economy.

#### **Did you know?**

South Korea broadcasts propaganda across the border using loudspeakers. The purpose of this to inform the North Korean soldiers about the weather, news around the world, sometimes even music, all of which is regulated and some even restricted in North Korea. This does anger North Korea, as it claims that it’s an act of war. While these loudspeaker operations are on and off at times, some say it's an excellent bargaining chip when it comes to negotiations with the North, others say that it just pisses them off.
