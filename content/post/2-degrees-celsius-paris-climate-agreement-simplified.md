+++
Actually, it's 1.5 Degree Celsius (2.7 Degrees Fahrenheit) that's been set as the limit for an increase in worldwide temperature. Wondering why such a small amount is alarming? Well, it is because if the worldwide temperature increases by that number, the effects on the world would be irreversible. The increase in temperature would not only affect the weather, but also the food, health, environment, and even the habitability of certain places. In the past attempts were made to have a climate agreement that everyone can adopt (such as the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed at reducing the emissions of CO2 and greenhouse gases). But seeing that we are on a verge of a global catastrophe (not like the movies 2012, and San Andreas) all the nations in the world has come together for this Paris Climate Agreement. But what is it?

### Basis of the agreement

Unlike other agreements that were in work, this agreement is solely based on the country itself. While the agreement does have a common goal that is to not let the temperature increase by 2C (later reduced to 1.5C) and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the framework allows every country to work out its own goals to reduce these emissions according to their capability. This is a much better way than the previous attempts where all nations had to abide by the same regulations. This way a country can set regulations according to their economy and abide by the agreement. The agreement also makes sure that the country takes the environment and biodiversity as an important part of climate change. The parties ratifying the agreement have to also send reports of their reduction in emissions for transparency purposes and there is no punishment for non-compliance.

### Symbolic gesture

This is the first time the world has set aside its disputes to counter the climate change which is now at the top of the global issues. It is to be noted that carbon emission and greenhouse gases will increase due to developing nations and each country trying to achieve its economic goal, but this is the first in global cooperation to reduce the changes in a climate so that we don't have to pay for the consequences in the future. The agreement even lets the developed countries help developing and other countries with an unstable economy to help them reach their climate goal.

### The Biggest Setback?

This year, the United States pulled out of the Paris Agreement thanks to President Donald Trump. Why did he pull out from the agreement? Because he's Donald Trump. And he believes that the agreement would affect the country's economy. His speech dubbed as "Pittsburgh, not Paris" where he stated the withdrawal from the agreement also covers his reasons. He states that the agreement is "simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers…and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.” Pulling out of the agreement will not bring back those jobs. He also stated that the US will re-enter the agreement if new terms that are fair to the United States are negotiated, to which many heads of other countries said is not possible. The agreement does not affect the US like that. Remember, the agreement allows the party to have its own goal to reduce emissions. But someone President does not understand that. After all, he wrote this on Twitter regarding global warming.

And if you believe that it's old, Let me remind you that in his 2018 Budget, he reduce EPA's budget by 30%. EPA stands for Environmental Protection Agency and mainly helps reduce pollution in the country by passing new regulations in order to save the environment.

In terms of world history, the United States has been a dominating power and influence in the world. Withdrawing from an agreement like this not only secludes it from other nations but also affects the dominance it had so long. And just to show you how bad it is, the only countries that have not signed the treaty are Syria (due to civil war) and Nicaragua (Criticised that the agreement does not punish countries for non-compliance, though Nicaragua will pursue its own climate change goal). The agreement came into force in November 2016 so the US can withdraw as early as November 4, 2020.

### Some Hope

Despite the United States withdrawal from the agreement, major tech companies, states, and majors of certain cities have pledged to abide by the Paris agreement. Even the major of Pittsburgh's has stated that the city will upload the agreement. As a matter of fact, Hawaii has become the first US state to pass laws that align them with the Paris agreement. So despite Trump's pull-out. The majority of American states and companies will work towards the agreement. Even other countries are looking into further ways to reduce their emissions. So overall things aren’t that bad. Right?
