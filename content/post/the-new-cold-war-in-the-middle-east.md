title = "The New Cold War, In the Middle East"

+++
At this point in time, there are wars, political crisis and uprisings in the middle east. But all this comes down to two countries in the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Iran has a majority Shia Islam in their country, compared to Saudi Arabia who has a Sunni majority. The two countries are bent to have their influence in the middle east, and to do so, just like the cold war between the US and USSR, engage in proxy warfare.

### What is going on?

While the conflict can be traced back as far as the Iranian Revolution, the Arab spring of 2011 has been the main aspect that reignited the conflict and brought it to where it is right now.

The examples of proxy warfare between the two countries can be seen in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen. In Syria, Saudi Arabia supports the Sunni rebels, who sought to overthrow the Syrian President Bashar- Al-Assad(Shia), by funding and supplying weapons to the rebels. Meanwhile, Iran supports the regime by sending funds as well as using Hezbollah and other Shiite militant groups.

Similar situation in Yemen, where Saudi supports the Yemenis government by providing airstrikes against the Houthis Rebels, financed by Iran.

There are other places where the countries have involved themselves in

#### Qatar

Warming ties between Iran and Qatar, accusations of funding terror organisations as well as using its state-media Al Jazeera to criticise Saudi Arabia and Egypt on certain issues led to closing all diplomatic ties with Qatar. Iran began to help Qatar by supplying Food and other necessary materials.

#### Lebanon

With elections coming in Lebanon, both the countries are trying to sway the elections to have a government favourable to theirs, with Saudi supporting Sunni prime minister Saad Hariri while Iran supports Shia group Hezbollah. Iran gained influence in the region after the elections with Saad losing one-third of his seats.

#### Israeli-Palestine Conflict.

Saudi Arabia initially was hostile to Israel, but now seek to have warmer ties with them. Iran, on the other hand, sees Israel as a threat, and vice versa. Both seek the total destruction of each other. A recent encounter between the two countries occurred regarding Iranian Nuclear Deal.

### Why does it matter?

These countries have engaged in a long and costly proxy war that are damaging the proxy countries and any chances for resolution in the conflict and issue they’re involved in. This also further destabilises the already fragile region, and any more confrontations can result in an all-out war with the other country.
