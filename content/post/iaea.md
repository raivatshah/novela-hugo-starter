International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) was created in 1957 acts as an inter-governmental forum in the field of Nuclear energy. It's objective is to ensure the safe, secure and peaceful use of Nuclear Energy and to avoid Nuclear proliferation. This also includes sharing of knowledge regarding Nuclear Science, contributing to international peace and Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. IAEA is considered as the "Atoms for peace organisation" within the United Nations Family. The creation of IAEA began from Eisenhower's speech in the United Nations on 8th December 1953, which led to the formal creation of the Agency in 1957, with its Headquarters in Vienna, Austria.

IAEA is essential for International Peace. Just like the United Nations, an organisation like the IAEA is required to monitor the use of nuclear energy in a peaceful manner and promote non-proliferation.

However, the organisation has faced criticism regarding the handling of the nuclear disaster in Japan (Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, 2011), stating that IAEA hasn't learnt from the Chernobyl disaster that had occurred 25 years ago. These limitations are due to the statue of the Agency. For example, it is not mandatory for nations to comply with the recommendations made by the agency. It is also burdened with promoting and monitoring the use of nuclear energy and ensuring compliance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Despite its limitations, the existence of such an organisation has helped promote Nuclear Non-Proliferation and the use of Nuclear energy in a peaceful and constructive manner.
