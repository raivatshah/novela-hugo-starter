Forty-Four years, that's how long the United Kingdom has been a member of the European Union. So far we have known that Brexit is simply the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU. That's all. But what if there's more to it? What if the process of leaving the EU is more complicated than previously imagined? The EU is a well-integrated union in terms of trades, culture, immigration, and industrialisation. This also includes its own currency and a single market. With all this, why would the UK want to leave the EU?

### Reasons to leave the European Union

Benefits of being in the EU are immigration and business transactions among other things can be done easily relative to other countries. That is, a French citizen can live in the UK and can work in the UK without any visa. Similarly business does not need to pay tariffs for cross-border trading which increase trade as well. However, this also comes at a disadvantage. Having a central bank that governs the flow of money for 28 nation's means that the countries who have adopted the Euro cannot have drastic changes in their economic policies. Fortunately, the UK did not adopt the Euro. But still, needs to send 350 million pounds (it comes down to 120 million pounds due to rebates and money it receives from the EU). The UKIP (United Kingdom Independent Parties) have used this a lot in their campaigns to persuade the UK citizens to join their campaign of leaving the EU.

_The reasons to leave the EU are simple. The UK wants:_

\- Control over its border, and immigration. (As net immigration increases which media and other politicians have linked to lower wages, jobs, increase in housing etc.)

\- The sovereignty of their nation (able to control their country, which many believe the EU has taken that away)

\- Control over monetary policy, and freedom to trade with countries outside the bloc

### Post-Brexit and Snap election

After the referendum results, the pound fell by 10% against the dollar. The then Prime Minister David Cameroon stepped down from his position because he was against leaving the EU and stated: "I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction". Following his resignation, Theresa May stepped to become the new Prime Minister. She is a firm believer in Brexit and on March 29, she triggered Article 50.

According to Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty which came into force in 2009, any member state can withdraw from the bloc after notifying the EU Council. Before no member state can formally leave the bloc. It will then take the state 2 years to leave the EU bloc and within that time period, new deals such as trade, immigration, border security etc. would be negotiated. If any conclusive deal is not made between the 2 parties within this time period, the state would indefinitely leave the bloc. If that happens then the UK must trade with the EU under the guidelines of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It is to be noted that any deal negotiated between the UK and the EU would go through their respected parliaments. With all this, 2 years seems to be very less. However, this time period can be extended if the remaining 27 countries unanimously vote to do so. However, it's more probable that it won't happen so no other country leaves the EU by setting an example with the UK.

There are a lot of regulations and treaties of the EU which the UK relies on. Leaving the EU means it needs to create new departments for Trade, labour, industries etc. Do note that the UK cannot have trade deals yet with any other country because it would violate the EU treaties. It can only do so after it leaves the Bloc.

In order to have a strong hand while going into the negotiations with the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May called for a snap election (the next parliamentary elections were to happen in 2 or 3 years) in order to gain a majority in the house. However, it was a big setback for her party and the snap election resulted in a "hung" parliament. Now with just 3 days left before the talks begin, it is uncertain how those negotiations between the two parties would be.

### Hard Brexit or Soft Brexit?

There are various ways that the UK can leave the EU. They are however been loosely categorised as Soft Brexit and Hard Brexit.

A Hard Brexit, which many of the leave voters want, is for Britain to completely leave the EU, trade with the EU under WTO regulations and take control of their borders, meaning that it will be able to control the immigration which was not possible when they were part of the bloc. This type of Brexit is being favoured by a lot of people and even Politicians. While it will be beneficial in terms of trade for the UK, the goods exported to the EU would become the subject of tariff and checks on goods. The border security would also become the main concern for the UK especially with the Republic of Ireland, with whom they had a bad history of border posts and security checks. Though the May's administration has said that they will attempt to avoid the "borders of the past".

A Soft Brexit would be where Britain won't be taking part in EU internal affairs, though they will be part of a single market. And being part of the single market means there won't be any tariffs or border checks imposed on its goods. This, however, forfeits their right to border control as the country would have agreed to the 'four freedoms' of movement of goods, services, capital, and people. This type of model also enables them to trade with other countries such as the US, China, India, etc. This, however, contradicts the reasons to leave the EU (One of them being control of its borders). So far Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein have such an agreement with the EU. This does not make them a member of the EU, but rather part of the European Economic Area.

### What's next?

With a hung parliament and time running out, the UK is in a terrible position. They not only need to work out deals with the EU but also make sure they go through their parliament without any major changes. If no deal is struck, not only trade would be affected by this, but also the British citizens living in EU member states and EU citizens living in the UK. All in all talks between the 2 should not be delayed. Though PM Theresa May has stated "Better to Have No Deal than a Bad Deal"
