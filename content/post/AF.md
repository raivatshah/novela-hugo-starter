+++
Here's the scenario. Something happens in western countries, there are hundreds of thousands of social media posts condemning the incident, a snap-story on snap chat that shows what’s happening on the ground, and all the media outlets and newspapers cover the whole issue. So far from the media, we know about the bombings done by ISIS, the situation in Syria and Iraq, and other incidents that occur in the more developed and stable part of the world. But what about the places we barely hear about? Why isn't the media covering such incidents and issues that are impacting the lives of people in that region? This post will give you a brief summary of all the major conflicts occurring in Africa. It is to be noted that Africa has a history of complicated conflicts and some of these conflicts are because of a previous one. If required, a separate post will cover everything. But for now, here’s the summary.

**The Libyan Civil War**

Post the Arab Spring and ousting of Libya’s Dictator Gaddafi, the situation in Libya got worse as factions of militia (formed during the uprising) now control parts of the country. This has resulted in continuous violence between the factions and UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). This situation has been going on since 2014.

**South Sudanese Civil War**

South Sudan is the world’s youngest country, formed in 2011 after getting independence from Sudan. Now it faces another civil war within itself. In 2013 a power struggle between South Sudan’s president Kiir and his former Deputy Machar had ignited the war. Uganda deployed its troops along with the UN peacekeeper forces to aid the South Sudan government. Numerous ceasefires and agreements were signed. However, conflict broke out again. As off now, 300 thousand people have died in the conflict, with 2 million internally displaced and about a million fleeing to neighboring countries.

**  
Northern Mali Conflict**

In January 2012, several insurgent groups started fighting the Mali government in the north in order to have an autonomous state called Azawad. However, in March a coup-d’état took place in Mali as the president was ineffective in handling the crisis. As a result of the insurgents (calling themselves National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, MNLA) who were also fighting for the homeland of the Tuareg people, were able to swiftly captured parts of Northern Mali. By April they called off their offense and proclaimed the independence of Azawad from Mali. Soon enough France along with other countries began to aid Mali in retaking their territory. As of now, the conflict is ongoing though it’s at a lower level.

**  
Central African Republic Civil War**

In 2012, a coalition of rebel groups calling themselves seleka was formed and stated that the government had failed to abide by the peace agreement made back in 2007. They later attacked and seized control of the capital. Their leader Djotodia is declared president of CAR. Despite all this, the country remained in turmoil, especially in sectarian violence with clashes occurring between ex-seleka and Anti-Balaka factions. UN peacekeeping forces along with French troops are present in the country. **  
  
War in Somalia**

Southern parts of Somalia at facing a lot of violence as various Islamists factions attempt to take control, especially Al-Shabaab. Along with Somalia, African Unions peacekeeping forces have also been deployed to assist the government. The issue has been going on since 2009

**  
Insurgency in Egypt**

There are 2 different Insurgency in Egypt. One in the Sinai Peninsula and one in central and western Egypt. The Sinai Peninsula began when Former President Mubarak was being ousted during the Arab spring. The Insurgency includes the local tribesmen and other militia. In 2014 the militants pledged allegiance to ISIL (The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as ISIS).

The second Insurgency in Western and central parts of Egypt began after the ousting of President Morsi in 2013 coup d’état. The new Islamist militants attempted to install Islamist rule in Egypt. Hence clashes between government forces and militants continue from bombings to low-level fighting. **  
  
ISIL in Tunisia**

Tunisia was the supposed place from where the Arab Spring started back in 2011. The activity of ISIL in Tunisia began in summer of 2015 and is still ongoing ranging from attacks to gain territorial control to attacks on police and military personal.

**The unrest in Burundi**

The unrests began in April 2015 after the ruling party stated that the president of Burundi Pierre Nkurunziza will be running for another term. This sparked outrage among the opposition and the people. Protests erupted in the capital city Bujumbura which soon resulted in a violent response from the police. Subsequently, in May a failed coup took place which made things even worse.

As of now protests still continue to take place, as well as people attempt to flee the country. As of February 2017, about 380,000 refugees have fled the country, most of them are now in neighboring Tanzania.

**  
Kamwina Nsapu Rebellion**

As complicated as it sounds, the conflict has arisen in the DRC’s Kasai central region. The conflict is ethnic in nature as well as a rebellion against the country. The militia named after the leader Kamwina Nsapu himself mostly consisted of people under the age of 14. The conflict began on August 8th, 2016 and as of April 2017, the Kamwina Nsapu is dead. However, conflict still continues in the region.
