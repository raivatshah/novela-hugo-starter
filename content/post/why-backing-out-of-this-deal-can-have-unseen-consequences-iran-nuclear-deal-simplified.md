title = "Why backing out of this deal can have unseen consequences - Iran Nuclear deal Simplified "

+++
On May 8th, 2017, US President Donald Trump announced that the United States will be withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Deal, citing that “we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement”. This will effectively result in sanctions that were previously imposed by the US prior to the Nuclear Deal.

You might be wondering, “what nuclear deal is he talking about?”, “why is it so important?” And “what unseen consequences are we talking about?”

### Where does this begin?

While Iran’s history of the nuclear program is long and complex, it all started as a part of the US President D.Eisenhower’s “Atoms for Peace” program in 1953, where the United States supplied uranium to Iran for civilian purposes. It was of course during the time of the Shah, who favoured the west. After the Islamic revolution, which saw the overthrow of the Shah and rise of power of Ayatollah Khomeini, who despised the West (which also resulted in the Iran hostage crisis of 1979). This mistrust between the US and Iran spanned out to other issues as well, but mainly it revolved around nuclear energy. While there are accusations of Iran using uranium to develop nuclear weapons, this still hasn’t been ruled out by the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA), who in the early 2000s, had suspicions due to the irregular activity in the power plants.

Throughout this time, the United States, and the UN had imposed sanctions on Iran for not complying with IAEA safeguards and not allowing IAEA officials to enter the facility. In 2015, however, Iran reached a deal with the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, Russia (P5+1) and the EU. This deal came to be known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The deal, in its simplest bits, was to not let Iran enrich its uranium above 3.67%, which is enough for civilian purposes (electricity), but not for developing nuclear weapons. The deal also comprised of regular inspections by the IAEA. It was also one of the landmark achievement for former US president Barack Obama.

### So why cancel it so soon?

Current US President Donald Trump cites his reasons for the deal to be “one-sided” and that it could not have stopped Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Some believe that his decision has to do with the revelation done by Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who presented evidence obtained from Iran’s nuclear facilities showing that Iran has been developing nuclear weapons. While the data presented was outdated, and with IAEA claiming that Iran is complying with the JCPOA, Trump nevertheless pulled the US out of the deal and stated that it will also heavily sanction companies who continue to deal with Iran.

### What are the consequences of this?

A-lot. Firstly, it undermines the administration's credibility, especially with the possible peace and denuclearisation talks with North Korean leader Kim-Jong Un, which has a similar agenda. There is a possibility that North Korea can perceive the same fate as which happened with Iran, a deal struck today with the current administration can be withdrawn by the next.

Furthermore, while Iran and the remaining countries will attempt to salvage the deal, this can result in a possible nuclear arms race in the middle east and further conflicts in the same, with just a day after the withdrawal, Iran and Israel exchanged fire near Golan Heights, with Israel stating that Iran fired first from Syria, which Iran declines.

The remaining countries that are a part of the JCPOA condemn the withdrawal, while Israel and Saudi Arabia welcome it, who see Iran as their regional rival in the middle east.

Whether the deal would have resulted in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, or was simply appeasement and not diplomacy, This withdrawal of US from the Iran Nuclear deal further isolates them on the world stage, especially since they have already withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement and the TPP (Trans-Pacific Pact).
