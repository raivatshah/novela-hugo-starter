Fun fact; There are no “embassies” in Jerusalem, only consulate generals. This is interesting since Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Or is it?

It is generally assumed that a country can declare any one of its cities as capital (Or in the case of South Africa, 3). But Jerusalem is an interesting case. Since Israel is not the only country who claims the city as its capital.

As you may have heard of, the Israel-Palestine conflict has been going for decades now, and while it is too complex that it requires its own separate post, there as a few points of the conflict and issues that have affected Jerusalem’s status as well as making the opening of an embassy a huge deal.

**It starts off with a law**

In 1980, Israel passed a law stating that the “whole” of Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. In the six-day war (named because the war lasted for six days) of 1967, Israel, having west Jerusalem, captured and annexed East Jerusalem from Palestine and Jordan. Despite that, the international community considered it occupied territory. Hence after the law in 1980 making the “whole” of Jerusalem the capital of Israel, the United Nations condemned the action, not only because it was claiming occupied territory as part of their capital, but this also hinders the chance of a future Palestinian state, which sought to have the eastern part of the city as its capital. After the condemnation, member states shifted their embassies from Jerusalem to Tel-Aviv.

**So what is the fuss about?**

The United State’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel makes them go back on years of consensus the world had on the city’s status. It will be the first nation to have its embassy thereafter the UN condemnation in 1980. For those of you who are thinking why Jerusalem? What is so important about the city that has caused so many issues. Its the one factor that hasn’t been mentioned here yet.

Jerusalem has some of the holiest sites in the world for Jews, Muslim and even Christians. Initially, after 1947, Jerusalem was supposed to be declared as an “international city” under United Nations (Obviously that didn’t go well). Both sides, especially Israel, have concerns regarding its citizens and the holy sites that are in the city if the east side is given to the Palestinian Authority. By moving the embassy to Jerusalem, the US is now supporting its crucial ally’s claim, while losing its role as mediator in the conflict.

Overall, the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, not only sets back decades of consensus but also hinders any peace process in the region, while also resulting in violent protests by Palestinians on December 7th, 2017. This not only clouds the future of any possible peace talks, but also the possibility of a future Palestinian state, for which, a lot of people have died so far.
